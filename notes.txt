- home page
  - start invoice -> goes to invoices page, and opens "new invoice" section
  - edit invoice -> goes to edit invoice page, opens edit modal, allowing user to choose invoice by id from dropdown menu
  - add phone -> goes to phones page, opens "new phone" section

  - add customer -> goes to customers page, opens "new customer" section
  - add carrier -> goes to carriers page, opens "new carriers" section
  - add payment methods -> goes to payment methods page, opens "new payment method" section



- edit invoice page (this functionality adds new record to invoice_details)
  - if clicked from invoices page -> edit button -> opens edit modal with fixed invoice id
  - if clicked from "edit invoice" from home page, opens edit modal, allowing user to choose invoice by id from dropdown menu

  - has "add phone" button to add another form input to choose a phone from dropdown
  - should be submitted through javascript since "add phone to invoice" dynamically changes invoice (maybe? maybe not?)



- Phones
  - each phone has "add to invoice" button. modal pops up to select invoice id from dropdown, submit or cancel
    - submit will add phone to "invoice_details" table

======================

- create new invoice and edit invoice forms are unique, they might require their own full page or modal
- need to have "add phone" button on invoice form, dynamically create a new phone field with JS, and have the back end accept this dynamic shaped form
- pay button needs to enforce that a payment method was selected (maybe enable/disable depending on value of payment method)
